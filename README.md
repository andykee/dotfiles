# dotfiles
A collection of dotfiles tailored to meet my needs. Based on [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) by mathiasbynens.

## Installation
To install/update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source dotfiles.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source dotfiles.sh
```

### Features


## Extras


### `osx.sh`


### `brew.sh`


### Colors


### Fonts



### Install custom Terminal profile on OSX

Open Terminal preferences and import ```monokai.terminal``` from the dotfiles directory. Set it as default.



### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files.

### Colors
solarized (lion terminal config in extras)
molokai - https://github.com/tomasr/molokai
gruvbox
(can I make these all pathogen plugins?)


### `vim` plugins
* vim-airline - NOTE requires source code pro 2.010 or later for powerline font support
