* Add line in osx.sh to show hidden directories in finder
* Programming-specific preferences files for Sublime - MATLAB (non-forced wrapping) and Python, at a minimum. Probably need a custom default too if possible
* Fix the sorting issue with folders and files in finder file view (they are not snapping to a grid or sorting by name right now)
